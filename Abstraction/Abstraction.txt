Abstract Methods:
1- A method without any method body is known as abstract method .
2- What the Method contains is only Declartion of the method.
3- A Class contains any abstract members in it but it must do that the class will also declared as "abstract keyword".
4- Implement each and every abstract method of parent class . Now only we can consume non-abstract methods of parent class under the child class.
5- From where we implication the abstract method we used "override keyword" Just like we used in the overriding.

Public abstract void Add(int x , int y).

Example:

Abstract class Class1 { public abstract void show(); }

Class Class2 : Class1 { Public override void show() }
